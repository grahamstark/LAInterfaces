##  Simulating Legal Aid Entitlement

## Legal Aid In Scotland

* &pound;150m pa 
* Originated in WW2 to help divorcing soldiers;
* Scottish System relatively generous 
* 3 types
    - Advice And Assistance "Quickie" legal aid for 1 hour of a solicitor's time, with very basic means test;
    - Civil - divorce, housing etc. complex means test;
    - Criminal - No means-test for Criminal Legal Aid: "A socicitor will be provided"; 

## The Problem 

* Complexity
    - lots of small individual allowances - travel to work, etc
* [Scottish Parliament Enquiry](https://www.parliament.scot/chamber-and-committees/committees/current-and-previous-committees/session-6-equalities-human-rights-and-civil-justice-committee/correspondence/2025/civil-legal-aid-inquiry-ercs-21-may-2025)
    - concerns: complexity, not targetted at correct groups (esp non-criminal domestic abuse cases, child cases)
    - committee sessions are worth watching;
    - model used heavily in responses.

## Previous work

* Our model builds on earlier work for the England And Wales Legal Aid Board [@buck_means_2001;@buck_simplicity_2003;] 
* the Scottish and Northern Irish Legal Aid Boards [@digan_financial_2007;@StarkSLAB]. 

* England And Wales work built on IFS's Taxben model; 
* Scottish work used [legal-aid only simulation written in ADA](https://github.com/grahamstark/scottish_legal_aid). 

The E&W work is especially interesting as an attempt at formally modelling the simplification of a complex benefit.

## LASim

- objectives
- previous work was solely entitlement based

## Scotben

- as seen 
- fully open source

## problems

- entitlement 
- dodgy data
