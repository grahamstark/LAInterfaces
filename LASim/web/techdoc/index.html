Instead of calculating liability to taxes and entitlements to benefits, it instead simply took recorded FRS values for these things and used those in its LA calculations. The current system is a general purpose tax-benefit model which makes it's own estimates of household liabilities and entitlements given the rules of the fiscal system. We chose this approach chiefly because the benefit system, in particular, is changing rapidly, especially with the phased introduction of Universal Credit. To model Scotland with reasonable accuracy, you need to 'pool' multiple years of FRS data and, unless you override recorded benefit receipts with values calculated on the current regime, older data becomes unrepresentative.
